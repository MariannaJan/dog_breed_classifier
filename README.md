### Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree and Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This is a project, that has been realised first as a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree, and afterwards it has been enriched with the necessary documantation, that was a part of Capstone Project in Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

This project aims at constructing and training a machine learning mechanism, that is able to classify images. Any appropriately preprocessed image, given to the mechanism should result in one of three possible outputs:
* if the image is a picture of a dog, the mechanism should output information about the breed of the dog
* if the image is a picture of a human, the mechanism should suggest what dog breed is most resembling the shown human
* in any other case the mechanism should inform user, that the image contains neither a picture of a dog nor of a human.

This is in fact a multi class classification task, aimed at correctly classifying images according to a dog breed of a dog pictured on them.
